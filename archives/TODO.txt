- Better transcription of handwriting
- the UI for selecting the question can be creating a box on the image



What are the steps:
1. Get the question and solution
2. Transcribe all the students' answers
3. Add a rubric or suggest a rubric for the question
4. Score each student's answer
5. Provide analytics and the ability to go through and ensure accuracy (compare to known grades)


Run many times to understand the accuracy of the grading (this can also be done for normal grading, and inconsistent ones can be flagged!)


What are types of questions:

- True/False
- Multiple choice
- Short answer
- Long answer
- Proof
- Calculation
- Graphing
- Multiple parts that are dependent (ignore for now)
